                        Many of these plans need the commitment and effort of people,
                        especially those who live in the archipelago. {"\n\n"}
                        One of these ideas is to commit government institutions to carry out a stricter control in the entrance and exit channels of exotic species, since not only the introduced animals represent a danger, but those that leave
                        illegally, mocking the airport controls. {"\n\n"}
                        Regarding the species already introduced, ideas have been proposed to reforest with endemic species, through agreements with farmers in the area and, in addition, to put into practice a type of organic and friendly cultivation with the ecosystem of the islands. {"\n\n"}
                        Another alternative that is being applied is to empower the inhabitants of the islands so that they are the main guardians of the endemic species, animals and plants, of the different areas of Galapagos.{"\n\n"}
                        A sustainable economy and production project is already running, in which organic matter is being processed to market organic, environmentally friendly organic products. On the other hand, artisanal fishing is
                        gaining ground, which is intended to end illegal hunting.{"\n\n"} 
                        And, in 2018, it was closed with the approval of the law prohibiting the use of disposable plastics, especially t-shirt covers, in all the Galapagos Islands. These measures and initiatives seek to recover ecosystems and
                        preserve the flora and fauna of the Galapagos Islands. </Text>
