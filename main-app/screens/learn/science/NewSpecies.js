                        In fact, since 2009 they have
                        been discovering more animal and plant species. Among the ten species discovered, we find two new
                        species of fish: Scorpaenodes sp and Gobiomuros sp.{"\n\n"} 
                        
                        In the Wolf Volcano, what scientists describe as a "living fossil" was discovered: the pink iguana.{"\n\n"}
                        
                        Under the sea, in 2012, a new species of cat shark was discovered: Bythaelurus giddingsi, barely thirty centimeters in length. On the other hand,
                        three species of corals were found, one of them was believed extinct, but survived the El Niño
                        phenomenon. {"\n\n"}
                        
                        The lichens added to their family ten new species and the finches have a new companion,
                        which despite being discovered twenty years ago, in 2009 it was registered as a new species. {"\n\n"}
                        
                        In 2018, scientists from Brazil and Ecuador found three new species of snakes. {"\n\n"}
                        
                        These findings and the species already known before, show us that the Galapagos Islands are a living laboratory and that, although
                        their species have evolved and developed in inhospitable environments, their ecosystems are fragile.</Text>
